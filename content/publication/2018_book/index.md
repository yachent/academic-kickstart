abstract = "Reducing power outage time to each customer is essential to the overall distribution reliability. This book provides the fundamentals of emergency operation using a graph-theoretic approach and exploration of the subsystem(s) that address the operational aspects of electrical fault occurrence to determine possible feeder reconfiguration. The localization of a faulted segment within a feeder involves remote-controlled normally open (NO) and normally closed (NC) switches through supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) between radially energized, interconnected feeders. Topics cover: (1) Data extraction from geographic information systems (GIS), (2) Graph modeling of distribution feeders, (3) Programming for backward/forward sweeping unbalanced power flow, (4) Short circuit analysis and fault localization, (5) Fault isolation, temporary and full service restoration, (6) Outage management and crew coordination, (7) Trouble call tickets and escalation to search for fault, and (8) Emerging subject of distribution management systems (DMS)."
